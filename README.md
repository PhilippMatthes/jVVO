# ðŸš†jVVO
Java (Android) Framework for VVO (Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe) - Ported form kiliankoe/dvb

*`Adapted from kiliankoe/dvb`*

This is an unofficial Java package giving you a few options to query Dresden's public transport system for current bus- and tramstop data - ported from the Swift Version on kiliankoe/dvb.

Want something like this for another language, look [no further](https://github.com/kiliankoe/vvo#libraries) ðŸ™‚

## Installation

It is recommended to use gradle with jVVO to supply all needed packages. For a android project, use the following gradle build settings:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.2'
compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.0'
annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.0'
implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.0.0'
```


## Quick Start

***Caveat***: Stops are always represented by their ID. You can get a stop's ID via `Stop.find()`. Some of the methods listed below offer convenience overloads, which are listed here since they look nicer. The downside to these is that they have to send of a find request for every stop first resulting in a significant overhead. Should you already have a stop's ID at hand I **strongly** suggest you use that instead.

### Monitor a single stop

Monitor a single stop to see every bus, tram or whatever leaving this stop. The necessary stop id can be found by using the `find()` function.


```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

Departure.monitorByName("Hauptbahnhof", queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        System.out.println(response.getResponse().get().getDepartures());
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```

### Find a specific stop

Say you're looking for "Tharandter StraÃŸe". You can use the following to find a list of matches.

```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

Stop.find("Tharandter StraÃŸe", queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        System.out.println(response.getResponse().get().getStops());
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```

### Find a route from A to B

Want to go somewhere?

```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

Route.findByName("Tharandter StraÃŸe", "Hauptbahnhof", queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        for (Route route : response.getResponse().get().getRoutes()) {
            // Do something with routes
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```

Or if you already have the stop IDs:

```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

Route.find("33000155", "33000028", queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        for (Route route : response.getResponse().get().getRoutes()) {
            // Do something with routes
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```

### Look up current route changes

Want to see if your favorite lines are currently being re-routed due to construction or some other reason? Check the published list of route changes.

```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

RouteChange.get(queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        for (RouteChange change : response.getResponse().get().getChanges()) {
            System.out.println(change.getTitle());
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```

### Lines running at a specific stop

Looking to find which lines service a specific stop? There's a func for that.

```java
RequestQueue queue = Volley.newRequestQueue(this);

Line.getByName("Hauptbahnhof", queue, response -> {
    if (response.getResponse().isPresent()) {
        System.out.println(response.getResponse().get().getLines());
    } else {
        System.out.println(response.getError().get().getDescription());
    }
});
```
